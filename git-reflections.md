#Git Reflections
1.Why would you want to version control your code?
Version controls allows for bug detection, a clean format for viewing  and comparing versions, let's you see previous features, test experimental
features, ensure history and code integrity, and enables smooth collaboration.
2.Where can you find additional information about the Git commands available?
  *git help -a
  *https://git-scm.com/docs
  *https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/git/command-prompt
3.Why are branches useful?
Branches allow for splitting up tasks, testing experimental features, private work, and smooth and efficient workflow/tracking.
4.What is the purpose of a remote?
Remote allows to set the push/pull locations; where your code is stored. Two types of addresses can be pushed: HTTPS and SSH.
5.Why is it important to track changes to the upstream repository after you create your initial fork?
Tracking changes that others or owner makes to the repository, and track the repository commits/branches. This is important if you
will be in some way contributing or need to have access to the different versions that will exist.
