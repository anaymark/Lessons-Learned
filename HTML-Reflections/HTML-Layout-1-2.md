1.Google the <br> (line break) tag. Explain why it should be used minimally if at all.
One of the most important issues with the <br> tag is the rendering of text on different size screens can create issues with the intended break of text. Placement is an issue. Better planning of text placement and use of minimal whitespace is advised instead of <br> tag.
2.What are the differences between the <div>, <section>, and <aside> tags?
<div> is an undefined or not yet defined page space divider that can be assigned to be a section or an aside. While <section> and <aside> tags are specific location placement dividers.
3.Why are there multiple kinds of <h> tags?
There are 6 <h> tags that decrease in size from the largest <h1> to the smallest <h6>.
